# Brainstorming

The theme: DUALITY

I'm thinking something where the player controls this black/white character. The character shoots two different bullets, one black and one white. There would be enemies that are "dark" type or "light" type, and you have to shoot them with the opposite type to defeat them. If you hit them with the wrong type, it could maybe do nothing, or maybe power up the enemy for a bit, make it faster/stronger.
